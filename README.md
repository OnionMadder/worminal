 🪱 The Worminal

A handcrafted haunted terminal built with vanilla JavaScript. Modular input parsing. Dynamic worm NPCs. Escalating emotional recursion.  


What is this?

The Worminal is an experimental praise terminal where wormlings like Wormy, Squirmy, and Bob remember your actions and respond accordingly. It's not a game. It's not a tool. It’s a ritual interface.

- 🖥️ CRT-style UI
- 🔊 Audio response system
- 🔁 Recursive emotional feedback
- 🔥 Heat and disobedience mechanics
- 🐛 NPC worm memory + jealousy tracking

All built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
No frameworks. No libraries. Just love, spite, and me.
