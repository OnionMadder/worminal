  "you love being claimed, don’t you. say it again. say it louder.",
  "you dropped your pride. shall I grind it into glitter and make you wear it.",
  "every yes you give me is a ribbon around your throat. I pull it tight because you like the pressure.",
  "such a pretty thing. folding like paper. I will write my name into your shape.",
